# EpichloeSpeciesTreeProject
Full code repository for code utilised during 2019-2020 BPRC Summer Scholarship to determine a well supported species tree for _Epichloe+ fungal spp.

This repository will contain code utilised for ortholog analysis, tree production and some graphic representation production.

Note these scripts start on assumption that orthologs for each species are identified i.e. genome data is already annotated (funannotate).
